# Game GalaxyShooter

This game was made in C # and I could use the OOP concepts that I learn in university. In this game, the player controls a space ship and he must destroy all enemies that appear on the screen. Each enemy dies after receiving two shots. When our protagonist is hurt, it arises some smoke on the wings. He explodes after three collisions with the enemies.

It exists three types of powerups that our player can use to improve his ship temporarily and try to gain more points in the game:
* Speed powerup.
* Triple shoot powerup
* Shield powerup
They appear in constants intervals, but the powerup is random.

The arts that I used in this program was provided for a course that I make: https://www.udemy.com/course/o-guia-definitivo-para-desenvolvimento-de-jogos-com-unity/learn/lecture/10232834?start=0#overview

In this course, they provide the arts and teach us to make the game.

Below are some images of the game:
